# WordPress Lando

## üéπ Development

üë∑ Setting up a development environment with Lando

Lando is Docker-based, but should make things a bit easier than most Docker setups.

- Install [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/). We've tested it up to RC7.
- Clone this repository locally. If you are using Windows, make sure you've set `git` to use UNIX line endings.
- In a terminal go to the directory of the local repository clone.
- Run `lando start`.
- Wait for a few minutes for everything to begin loading. Subsequent starts will be much faster but you‚Äôll need to give it time for the very first start.
- You should see a `BOOMSHAKALAKA!!!` line üéâ
- In the `NGINX URLS` section of the output note the third URL (it should start with `http://wordpress.lndo.site` and maybe have a port).
- If the URL is different than `http://wordpress.lndo.site`, then run: `lando wp search-replace 'http://wordpress.lndo.site' '<URL>'`
- Logs are accessible via the [lando logs](https://docs.devwithlando.io/cli/logs.html) command. If you mostly care about PHP error log, a useful command is: `lando logs -s appserver -t -f`.

üõ†Run commands
There are bunch of pre-installed tools you can run. Then are run with `lando <tool> <command>` for example `lando composer install`. The available tools by default are listed below, but there are more that you can configure. Check the Lando documentation.

- php
- composer
- npm
- gulp
- yarn
- phpunit

There are also workflow commands that you can configure. The pre-configured ones are listed below. You can add as many as you want. Check Lando docs for all possibilities.

- `lando build` - this will run `npm start` from your package.json
- `lando watch` - this will run `npm run watch` from your package.json

‚Ü∫ Configuring BrowserSync
BrowserSync runs on port 3000. This setup already has port 3000 opened on the node container. Configure BrowserSync by specifying the port and the proxy URL. Example below.

```javascript
browserSync.init({
  proxy: "http://wordpress.lndo.site",
  port: 3000,
  open: false
});
```

To view BrowserSync proxied URL go to `http://wordpress.lndo.site:3000`

‚è∏ Debugging PHP with XDebug

- If using Lando, configure your IDE to listen to XDebug on port 9000 and map the server's `/app/` directory to the root of this repository.

‚è± Profiling PHP with XDebug

- If using Lando, simply append `XDEBUG_PROFILE` param to either GET or POST parameters. The profiler will write to the root of this repository.

üíâ Running tests:

- If using Lando you can run `lando phpunit` or `lando phpunit <php-file-with-tests>` in the main plugin directory.
- JavaScript tests: open `<URL-of-plugin-directory>/tests/test.html` in your browser.
